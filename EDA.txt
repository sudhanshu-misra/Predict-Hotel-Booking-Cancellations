Analysis of Numerical Features & Correlation
Below is the breakdown of how numerical features correlate with the cancellation status:

lead_time (0.43): The Strongest Predictor This shows the highest positive correlation. Longer lead times significantly increase the likelihood of cancellation. This aligns with business logic: bookings made far in advance carry higher uncertainty regarding future plans compared to last-minute bookings.

no_of_special_requests (–0.25): The "Commitment" Indicator This feature has a meaningful negative correlation. Guests who make special requests are less likely to cancel. This serves as a proxy for engagement; a guest who takes the time to customize their stay has firmer expectations and higher commitment.

arrival_year (0.18): Temporal Trends This shows a weak-to-moderate correlation. While not a behavioral trait of the user, it captures dataset-specific trends (e.g., specific years having higher cancellation rates due to external factors like post-COVID travel surges).

avg_price_per_room (0.14): Price Sensitivity There is a slight positive correlation indicating that as the room price increases, the probability of cancellation rises, likely due to price sensitivity or guests shopping around for better deals.

repeated_guest (–0.10): Customer Loyalty Returning guests show a lower probability of canceling. This confirms the logical pattern that repeat customers are a more stable and reliable demographic.

required_car_parking_space (–0.08): Logistical Constraints Guests requesting parking are less likely to cancel. These are likely travelers driving to the location with defined logistics, implying firmer travel plans.

Duration Features (no_of_week_nights / weekend_nights) Longer stays show a slight positive correlation with cancellations, potentially due to the higher complexity and uncertainty involved in planning longer trips.

Low Impact Features Features such as no_of_previous_cancellations, no_of_children, and specific arrival dates show negligible correlation in isolation, though they are retained for model completeness.

Key Takeaway

Correlations are generally weak to moderate, meaning no single numeric variable fully determines cancellation. This indicates that feature engineering and categorical variables will be important.
