Top Features Affecting Hotel Booking Cancellations
Using the trained Random Forest model, feature importances were extracted from the final pipeline. The top predictors are ranked below by their importance score.

1. lead_time (0.205) The longer a guest books in advance, the higher the cancellation probability. Plans made far in the future are more likely to change.

2. no_of_special_requests (0.108) Guests with more requests are less likely to cancel because they are more invested in the stay.

3. avg_price_per_room (0.099) Higher room prices tend to correlate with higher cancellations, likely due to price sensitivity or guests finding cheaper alternatives.

4. avg_price_per_person (0.087) Guests paying more per person may cancel more frequently due to budget changes or expectation mismatches.

5. arrival_date (0.075) Cancellations vary by specific dates within a month, indicating peak vs. off-peak patterns influence behavior.

6. arrival_month (0.071) Seasonality strongly affects cancellations (e.g., holidays, festivals, and school vacations).

7. lead_time_cat_long (0.042) Categorical confirmation that long-term bookings are the most volatile segment.

8. total_nights (0.037) Longer stays generally carry more uncertainty, leading to a slightly higher cancellation likelihood.

9. lead_time_cat_short (0.036) Short bookings are more stable; cancellations are significantly lower for bookings made with ≤30 days lead time.

10. no_of_week_nights (0.036) Longer weekday stays often correspond to work travel, which carries moderate cancellation risks.

11. market_segment_type_Online (0.030) Online bookings show higher cancellation rates compared to offline methods (walk-ins & agents are more stable).

12. no_of_weekend_nights (0.029) Short weekend getaways cancel more often, likely due to weather changes or shifting personal plans.

13. arrival_year (0.022) A slight yearly trend exists, likely reflecting market conditions or travel recovery phases.

14. market_segment_type_Offline (0.020) Offline bookings have lower cancellation rates; traditional channels prove to be more stable.

15. lead_time_cat_medium (0.015) Medium-term bookings remain moderately stable compared to long or short extremes.

16. total_guests (0.013) Group bookings can be harder to coordinate, slightly increasing the probability of cancellation.

17. no_of_adults (0.011) More adults implies more coordination required, leading to a slightly stronger cancellation tendency.

18. meal_plan_1 (0.007) Guests choosing specific meal plans may be more committed to the booking.

19. car_parking_required (0.007) Travelers requiring parking (usually driving to the venue) show lower cancellation behavior.

20. Room type 1 reserved (0.006) Specific room types (likely standard rooms) dominate booking behavior but have low individual predictive power.

Business Interpretation
The model shows that cancellations are most influenced by booking behavior (lead time), seasonality (arrival month/date), pricing (ADR per room/person), and booking channel (online/offline).

Lead Time & Pricing: Guests who plan far ahead or pay higher prices are significantly more likely to cancel.

Commitment Indicators: Guests who make special requests or use offline booking channels tend to be more committed and less likely to cancel.

Seasonality: This plays a major role, suggesting that hotels should monitor monthly trends closely and adjust cancellation policies during volatile periods.
Strategic Recommendations
Based on the model’s findings—specifically the impact of lead time, pricing, and guest engagement—the following strategies are recommended to reduce cancellation rates and mitigate revenue loss:

1. Implement Dynamic Cancellation Policies (Targeting Lead Time) Since lead_time is the strongest predictor of cancellations (longer lead time = higher risk), the hotel should move away from a "one-size-fits-all" policy.

Action: Implement stricter cancellation policies for bookings made more than 90 days in advance (e.g., require a non-refundable deposit).

Action: Offer flexible cancellation only to "short lead time" bookings (≤ 30 days), as these guests are statistically less likely to cancel.

2. Increase Guest "Stickiness" (Targeting Special Requests) The data shows that guests with no_of_special_requests are significantly less likely to cancel.

Action: Actively encourage guests to make requests during the booking process.

Action: Send automated pre-arrival emails (e.g., "Customize your stay") asking about pillow preferences, room views, or dietary needs. This psychological "investment" increases the guest's commitment to the trip.

3. Value-Based Pricing Strategies (Targeting Price Sensitivity) High avg_price_per_room correlates with cancellations, suggesting guests may be "shopping around" for better deals after booking.

Action: Instead of lowering rates, bundle high-value add-ons (free breakfast, parking, or spa credits) with higher room rates. This makes it harder for the guest to find a comparable "deal" elsewhere, reducing the urge to cancel and rebook.

4. Channel-Specific Retention (Targeting Market Segments) Market_segment_type_Online has a higher churn rate compared to offline segments.

Action: Offer exclusive "Direct Booking" perks (e.g., late checkout or a 5% discount) for guests who switch from OTAs (Online Travel Agencies) to booking directly on the hotel website.

Action: For Corporate/Offline segments (low cancellation risk), focus on long-term contracts and loyalty rewards to maintain this stable revenue stream.

5. Smart Overbooking Strategy (Targeting Seasonality) Since arrival_month and arrival_date influence cancellations, the hotel can predict "high cancellation" periods.

Action: During months identified as high-risk by the model, slightly increase overbooking limits to compensate for the predicted wash-down.

Action: During low-risk months (stable bookings), reduce overbooking to avoid walking guests.
